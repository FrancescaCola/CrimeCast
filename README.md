## CrimeCast â€“ Predictive Crime Classification

This project is based on a crime dataset and aims to develop a predictive model capable of categorizing the type of crime committed.

> Please note: Python version **3.10 or 3.11** is required, as one of the libraries used for the neural network model is not compatible with later versions.

All necessary libraries are listed in the included `requirements.txt` file for easy setup.

**Feel free to explore, replicate, or build upon this work, every line of code brings us closer to understanding patterns behind human behavior.**
